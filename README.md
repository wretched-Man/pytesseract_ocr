# OCR and Translate with PyTesseract
This is a little OCR project I worked on. I used OCR with PyTesseract to detect and recognize text in specific images. The images are from Thayer's Greek Lexicon PDF in which I extracted every page as an image.
In this branch, I went ahead and used `googletrans` Google Translate API to translate and replace Greek text in the recognized text with English.

Since the files are large, I have provided pg22.jpg image and it's translation as an example.
